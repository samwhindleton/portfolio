# [Sam's 127.0.0.1](https://samwhindleton.com/)

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer and busy bee that loves creating scripts that complete multiple tasks in less time than it takes to take a sip of coffee. Constantly looking for efficient ways to solve problems, and opportunities to learn and grow. Let's ./start.sh something new.

Welcome to my home on the world wide web! The best part about this neighborhood is that we're getting fiber installed next week, yaaas!

You're welcome to stay and look at my code. If you like what you see, don't be afraid to give that project a star ‚≠êÔ∏è I dare you.

Fork anything you'd like to take apart to see how it works. It's required that you make it 1,000 times better when you put things back together.

Oh and don't forget what I'm about to tell you because it's very important. You might want to take a seat. Are you sitting down? Are you really sitting down? Ok, well the important thing is... I need coffee ‚òïÔ∏è, a ridiculous amount of coffee!

So, before you leave, please press the brew button on the Keurig. There's already a Krispy Kreme k-cup in the Keurig, water in the reservoir, and my favorite mug underneath the spout.

Thanks Friend! ü§ì
